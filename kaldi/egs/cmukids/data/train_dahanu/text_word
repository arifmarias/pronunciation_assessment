THE FLYING ELEPHANT A BHILI FOLKTALE
GROW LARGER IN THE SKY
THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH SILVER GRASS AND PRECIOUS STONES
AND BECAME A VERY RICH MAN
AND SURE ENOUGH THE ELEPHANT FLEW DOWN ONE NIGHT
BUT INDRA HEARING OF THE VILLAGERS TRICK
THE ELEPHANT NEVER FELT THE NEED TO FLY DOWN AGAIN
THE VILLAGERS WAITED FOR MANY NIGHTS WATCHING THE SKY
BUT THE ELEPHANT NEVER CAME BACK DOWN AGAIN
A SUGARCANE FARMER ONCE LIVED IN A SMALL VILLAGE
HE WORKED VERY HARD IN HIS FIELDS
AND HOPED TO HAVE A BIG HARVEST
ONE MORNING HE SAW THAT A BIG CHUNK OF HIS CROP WAS MISSING
THE NEXT DAY ANOTHER HUGE CHUNK OF HIS CROP WAS GONE
ILL STAY AWAKE TONIGHT
AND SEE WHO IS EATING MY SUGARCANE
THE FARMER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
THAT NIGHT HE WAITED BY THE WINDOW WATCHING HIS FIELDS
AS THE MOON ROSE HE SAW A TINY SPECK
IT WAS AN ELEPHANT FLYING RIGHT INTO HIS FIELD
THE FARMER WATCHED IN AMAZEMENT
AS IT FLEW DOWN AND STARTED EATING HIS SUGARCANE
HE TIPTOED OUTSIDE AND WAITED FOR THE ELEPHANT TO FINISH EATING
WHEN THE ELEPHANT BEGAN FLYING AWAY
THE FARMER GRABBED ITS TAIL
IN ORDER TO CATCH THE ELEPHANT
SOON HE WAS FLYING ABOVE HIS FIELDS
INTO INDRAS KINGDOM OF PARADISE
PARADISE WAS FILLED WITH BEAUTIFUL BIRDS AND FLOWERS
THE FARMER SOON FOUND THE ROYAL PALACE AND MET INDRA
YOUR ELEPHANT HAS BEEN FLYING DOWN AND EATING ALL MY SUGARCANE
MY HARVEST IS RUINED SAID THE FARMER
I AM VERY SORRY
PLEASE TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT FROM MY KINGDOM
ILL MAKE SURE HE DOSENT GO DOWN AGAIN
AND DAMAGE YOUR CROPS SAID INDRA
AND BLESSED THE MAN WITH A SAFE JOURNEY BACK HOME
THE FARMER TOOK TWO HANDFULS OF GEMS AND RETURNED HOME
HE BUILT HIMSELF A NEW HOUSE
SOON THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT HIS SUDDEN WEALTH
ONE DAY SOME VILLAGERS WENT TO VISIT THE FARMERS WIFE
WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THIS MONEY
DID YOU FIND BURIED TREASURE IN YOUR FIELDS THEY ASKED
THE FARMERS WIFE TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPEND
THAT EVENING THE VILLAGERS DECIDED
TO LURE THE ELEPHANT DOWN THEMSELVES
WHEN WE GET TO PARADISE WELL TAKE MORE THAN
JUST TWO HANDFULS OF GEMS THEY SAID
THEY PLANTED A FIELD OF SUGARCANE
ONE VILLAGER GRABBED ITS TAIL AND SOON
THERE WAS A CHAIN OF VILLAGERS FLYING BEHIND THE ELEPHANT
AS THEY FLEW UP
THEY BEGAN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD BRING BACK
FINALLY IT WAS THE TURN OF THE VILLAGER HOLDING THE ELEPHANTS TAIL
IM GOING TO CARRY BACK THIS MANY GEMS HE DECLARED IN EXCITMENT
HE STRETCHED HIS ARMS WIDE AND LET GO OF THE ELEPHANTS TAIL
THE VILLAGERS ALL FELL IN A HEAP ON THE GROUND
THEY WATCHED SADLY AS THE THE ELEPHANT DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY
DONT WORRY THE ELEPHANT WILL COME BACK TOMORROW SAID THE VILLAGERS
ARRANGED FOR A SUGARCANE FIELD TO BE PLANTED IN PARADISE
THE FOUR FRIENDS
AS OUR FRIEND THE MOUSE KNOWS
FREE AT LAST THE DOVES FLEW AWAY
THE CROW FLEW IN EVERY DIRECTION LOOKING FOR HER
WHY DID YOU COME HERE
SHE LAY DOWN ABSOLUTELY STILL
HE RAN FOR HIS LIFE
THE FOUR FRIENDS CAME BACK HOME
AND WERE HAPPY TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN
RETOLD BY BOOKBOX
FAR FROM ANY TOWN THERE WAS A FOREST
IN WHICH ALL THE ANIMALS AND BIRDS LIVED TOGETHER PEACEFULLY
THE FOREST WAS HOME TO FOUR INSEPARABLE FRIENDS
A DEER A TORTOISE A CROW AND A MOUSE
EVERY EVENING THEY MET TO DISCUSS THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
BUT ONE DAY THE DEER BECAME VERY FRIGHTENED
HUNTERS ARE LAYING TRAPS EVERYWHERE
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ESCAPE
YES THERE IS THE CROW CRIED OUT
THE CROW BEGAN TELLING WHAT HE HAD SEEN
JUST THE OTHER DAY I SAW THE MOST AMAZING THING
A FLOCK OF DOVES GOT TRAPPED IN A HUNTERS NET
THEIR WINGS FLAPPING WILDLY
THEN SUDDENLY ALL TOGETHER
THE DOVES PICKED UP THE NET
IN THEIR BEAKS AND FLEW INTO THE SKY
AND WHERE DID THEY GO
STRAIGHT TO OUR FRIEND THE MOUSE
WITH HIS SHARP TEETH HE TORE THE NET TO PIECES
THEY WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO OUR FRIEND
AFTER THE STORY ENDED
THE DEER WENT IN SEARCH OF WATER
MEANWHILE THE THREE FRIENDS STARTED NIBBLING
ON THE FRUITS SHRUBHS AND THE LEAVES OF THE FOREST
THEY CHATTED LATE INTO THE NIGHT
STILL WAITING FOR THE DEER TO RETURN
BUT THE DEER WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
AND THE FRIENDS BEGAN TO WORRY
AT DAWN WHILE THE OTHERS CALLED OUT TO THE DEER
IN A CLEARING HE SPOTTED THE DEER
WITH HER FOOT CAUGHT IN A NET
DONT WORRY HE TOLD HER CALMLY
WE WILL THINK OF SOMETHING
THE CROW RUSHED BACK TO HIS FRIENDS
THE TORTOISE HAD AN IDEA
MOUSE HOP QUICKLY ON THE CROWS BACK
AND THEY FLEW OFF TO RESCUE THE DEER
WITHOUT WASTING TIME THE MOUSE BIT THROUGH THE NET
JUST THEN THE ANXIOUS TORTOISE REACHED THE SPOT
IF THE HUNTER RETURNS YOU WILL NEVER ESCAPE THE DEER EXCLAIMED
AND THE HUNTER DID RETURN
HEARING HIS FOOTSTEPS
ALL OF THEM RAN AWAY
BUT THE TORTOISE WAS TOO SLOW
THE HUNTER PICKED HIM UP AND TIED HIM TO A STICK
OH NO BECAUSE OF ME POOR TORTOISE IS IN TROUBLE
SAID THE DEER
SUDDENLY THE DEER LEAPED UP
AND RAN TO THE POND NEAR THE PATH
WHILE THE CROW PECKED AT HER
WHEN THE HUNTER DROPPED THE TORTOISE AND PICKED UP THE DEER
THE MOUSE QUICKLY CUT THE CHORDS
AND RELEASED THE TORTOISE
WHILE THE TORTOISE SLIPPED INTO THE WATER
THE DEER DARTED OFF
AND THE CROW SIMPLY FLEW AWAY
THE HUNTER TREMBLED WITH FEAR
HE HAD NEVER SEEN AN ANIMAL COME BACK TO LIFE
THINKING THAT THE FOREST WAS HAUNTED
THE LION AND THE FOX RETOLD BY DEEPA BALSAGAR
FINALLY SHE FOUND A MAN STANDING NEXT TO A PILE OF LOGS
THEY STARTED DISCUSSING HOW THEY WOULD SHARE THE FOOD
IF HE DID WOULD HE CUT ALL THE TREES
AND DESTROY THE FOREST
UP ON THE TREE THE MAN NODDED SADLY
THE FOX WAS RIGHT
HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AROUND FOR TREES TO JUMP ON TO AND RUN AWAY
BUT THERE WERE NONE NEARBY
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A THICK GREEN FOREST
WHERE THE ANIMALS HAD PLENTY TO EAT
THEN CAME MEN WITH MACHINES
AND THEY STARTED CHOPPING DOWN THE TREES
FEWER TREES MEAN FEWER ANIMALS
SOON THE MIGHTY LION FOUND THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ANYTHING LEFT TO EAT
WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND THE FOX
YOU FIND AN ANIMAL AND BRING IT TO ME
I WILL KILL IT AND THEN WE CAN BOTH EAT IT
THE FOX SEARCHED AND SEARCHED
THERE ARE BIGGER AND BETTER TREES ON THE OTHERSIDE OF THE FOREST
THE FOX SAID TO HIM
WHERE WHERE SHOW ME SAID THE GREEDY MAN
SO THE FOX LED THE MAN HERE AND THERE
AND ROUND AND ROUND THE FOREST AND TO WHERE
THE LION WAS WAITING
THE LION LEAPT TOWARDS THE MAN
THE MAN SHOT UP THE CLOSEST TREE JUST LIKE A MONKEY
THE LION AND THE FOX WERE NOT TOO WORRIED
THEY KNEW THE MAN COULD NOT ESCAPE
ILL START WITH THE TOES SAID THE LION
ILL START WITH THE FINGERS SAID THE FOX
ONE BY ONE THEY CHOSE WHO WOULD EAT WHAT
FINALLY THE LION LICKED HIS LIPS AND SAID
I WILL EAT THE BRAIN MMMMM
NOW THE FOX HAD ALSO BEEN DREAMING ABOUT EATING THE MANS BRAIN
SHE TOLD THE LION
BUT THIS ANIMAL HAS NO BRAIN
THE MUSICAL DONKEY RETOLD BY NIVEDITHA SUBRAMANIAM
AND THEN ONE DAY HE BEGAN TO SING WITH JOY
HE WAS DREAMING HE HAD A THOUSAND CUCUMBERS IN HIS FIELD
WHAT COULD THEY DO
ONE BY ONE THEY JUMPED OUT OF THE FIELD
AND RAN TO THE FARMERS HOUSE
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE FARMER WOKE UP HE WAS NOT ALONE
ALL AROUND HIM WERE CUCUMBERS WIDE AWAKE LOOKING AT HIM
AND IN THE FIELD THE DONKEY WAS FAST ASLEEP
DURING THE DAY THE DONKEY WORKED FOR THE WASHERMAN
AT NIGHT HE WENT FOR LONG WALKS WITH HIS FRIEND THE JACKAL
THE JACKAL NEVER LISTENED BUT THE DONKEY TALKED AND TALKED
UNTIL THEY REACHED THE CUCUMBER FIELD
THEN THE DONKEY WOULD OPEN HIS MOUTH WIDE
AND BITE INTO A FRESH JUICY CUCUMBER
