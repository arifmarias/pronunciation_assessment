THE FLYING ELEPHANT A BHILI FOLKTALE
GROW LARGER IN THE SKY
THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH SILVER GRASS AND PRECIOUS STONES
AND BECAME A VERY RICH MAN
AND SURE ENOUGH THE ELEPHANT FLEW DOWN ONE NIGHT
BUT INDRA HEARING OF THE VILLAGERS TRICK
THE ELEPHANT NEVER FELT THE NEED TO FLY DOWN AGAIN
THE VILLAGERS WAITED FOR MANY NIGHTS WATCHING THE SKY
BUT THE ELEPHANT NEVER CAME BACK DOWN AGAIN
A SUGARCANE FARMER ONCE LIVED IN A SMALL VILLAGE
HE WORKED VERY HARD IN HIS FIELDS
AND HOPED TO HAVE A BIG HARVEST
ONE MORNING HE SAW THAT A BIG CHUNK OF HIS CROP WAS MISSING
THE NEXT DAY ANOTHER HUGE CHUNK OF HIS CROP WAS GONE
ILL STAY AWAKE TONIGHT
AND SEE WHO IS EATING MY SUGARCANE
THE FARMER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
THAT NIGHT HE WAITED BY THE WINDOW WATCHING HIS FIELDS
AS THE MOON ROSE HE SAW A TINY SPECK
IT WAS AN ELEPHANT FLYING RIGHT INTO HIS FIELD
THE FARMER WATCHED IN AMAZEMENT
AS IT FLEW DOWN AND STARTED EATING HIS SUGARCANE
HE TIPTOED OUTSIDE AND WAITED FOR THE ELEPHANT TO FINISH EATING
WHEN THE ELEPHANT BEGAN FLYING AWAY
THE FARMER GRABBED ITS TAIL
IN ORDER TO CATCH THE ELEPHANT
SOON HE WAS FLYING ABOVE HIS FIELDS
INTO INDRAS KINGDOM OF PARADISE
PARADISE WAS FILLED WITH BEAUTIFUL BIRDS AND FLOWERS
THE FARMER SOON FOUND THE ROYAL PALACE AND MET INDRA
YOUR ELEPHANT HAS BEEN FLYING DOWN AND EATING ALL MY SUGARCANE
MY HARVEST IS RUINED SAID THE FARMER
I AM VERY SORRY
PLEASE TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT FROM MY KINGDOM
ILL MAKE SURE HE DOSENT GO DOWN AGAIN
AND DAMAGE YOUR CROPS SAID INDRA
AND BLESSED THE MAN WITH A SAFE JOURNEY BACK HOME
THE FARMER TOOK TWO HANDFULS OF GEMS AND RETURNED HOME
HE BUILT HIMSELF A NEW HOUSE
SOON THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT HIS SUDDEN WEALTH
ONE DAY SOME VILLAGERS WENT TO VISIT THE FARMERS WIFE
WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THIS MONEY
DID YOU FIND BURIED TREASURE IN YOUR FIELDS THEY ASKED
THE FARMERS WIFE TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPEND
THAT EVENING THE VILLAGERS DECIDED
TO LURE THE ELEPHANT DOWN THEMSELVES
WHEN WE GET TO PARADISE WELL TAKE MORE THAN
JUST TWO HANDFULS OF GEMS THEY SAID
THEY PLANTED A FIELD OF SUGARCANE
ONE VILLAGER GRABBED ITS TAIL AND SOON
THERE WAS A CHAIN OF VILLAGERS FLYING BEHIND THE ELEPHANT
AS THEY FLEW UP
THEY BEGAN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD BRING BACK
FINALLY IT WAS THE TURN OF THE VILLAGER HOLDING THE ELEPHANTS TAIL
IM GOING TO CARRY BACK THIS MANY GEMS HE DECLARED IN EXCITMENT
HE STRETCHED HIS ARMS WIDE AND LET GO OF THE ELEPHANTS TAIL
THE VILLAGERS ALL FELL IN A HEAP ON THE GROUND
THEY WATCHED SADLY AS THE THE ELEPHANT DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY
DONT WORRY THE ELEPHANT WILL COME BACK TOMORROW SAID THE VILLAGERS
ARRANGED FOR A SUGARCANE FIELD TO BE PLANTED IN PARADISE
THE FOUR FRIENDS
AS OUR FRIEND THE MOUSE KNOWS
FREE AT LAST THE DOVES FLEW AWAY
THE CROW FLEW IN EVERY DIRECTION LOOKING FOR HER
WHY DID YOU COME HERE
SHE LAY DOWN ABSOLUTELY STILL
HE RAN FOR HIS LIFE
THE FOUR FRIENDS CAME BACK HOME
AND WERE HAPPY TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN
RETOLD BY BOOKBOX
FAR FROM ANY TOWN THERE WAS A FOREST
IN WHICH ALL THE ANIMALS AND BIRDS LIVED TOGETHER PEACEFULLY
THE FOREST WAS HOME TO FOUR INSEPARABLE FRIENDS
A DEER A TORTOISE A CROW AND A MOUSE
EVERY EVENING THEY MET TO DISCUSS THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
BUT ONE DAY THE DEER BECAME VERY FRIGHTENED
HUNTERS ARE LAYING TRAPS EVERYWHERE
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ESCAPE
YES THERE IS THE CROW CRIED OUT
THE CROW BEGAN TELLING WHAT HE HAD SEEN
JUST THE OTHER DAY I SAW THE MOST AMAZING THING
A FLOCK OF DOVES GOT TRAPPED IN A HUNTERS NET
THEIR WINGS FLAPPING WILDLY
THEN SUDDENLY ALL TOGETHER
THE DOVES PICKED UP THE NET
IN THEIR BEAKS AND FLEW INTO THE SKY
AND WHERE DID THEY GO
STRAIGHT TO OUR FRIEND THE MOUSE
WITH HIS SHARP TEETH HE TORE THE NET TO PIECES
THEY WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO OUR FRIEND
AFTER THE STORY ENDED
THE DEER WENT IN SEARCH OF WATER
MEANWHILE THE THREE FRIENDS STARTED NIBBLING
ON THE FRUITS SHRUBHS AND THE LEAVES OF THE FOREST
THEY CHATTED LATE INTO THE NIGHT
STILL WAITING FOR THE DEER TO RETURN
BUT THE DEER WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
AND THE FRIENDS BEGAN TO WORRY
AT DAWN WHILE THE OTHERS CALLED OUT TO THE DEER
IN A CLEARING HE SPOTTED THE DEER
WITH HER FOOT CAUGHT IN A NET
DONT WORRY HE TOLD HER CALMLY
WE WILL THINK OF SOMETHING
THE CROW RUSHED BACK TO HIS FRIENDS
THE TORTOISE HAD AN IDEA
MOUSE HOP QUICKLY ON THE CROWS BACK
AND THEY FLEW OFF TO RESCUE THE DEER
WITHOUT WASTING TIME THE MOUSE BIT THROUGH THE NET
JUST THEN THE ANXIOUS TORTOISE REACHED THE SPOT
IF THE HUNTER RETURNS YOU WILL NEVER ESCAPE THE DEER EXCLAIMED
AND THE HUNTER DID RETURN
HEARING HIS FOOTSTEPS
ALL OF THEM RAN AWAY
BUT THE TORTOISE WAS TOO SLOW
THE HUNTER PICKED HIM UP AND TIED HIM TO A STICK
OH NO BECAUSE OF ME POOR TORTOISE IS IN TROUBLE
SAID THE DEER
SUDDENLY THE DEER LEAPED UP
AND RAN TO THE POND NEAR THE PATH
WHILE THE CROW PECKED AT HER
WHEN THE HUNTER DROPPED THE TORTOISE AND PICKED UP THE DEER
THE MOUSE QUICKLY CUT THE CHORDS
AND RELEASED THE TORTOISE
WHILE THE TORTOISE SLIPPED INTO THE WATER
THE DEER DARTED OFF
AND THE CROW SIMPLY FLEW AWAY
THE HUNTER TREMBLED WITH FEAR
HE HAD NEVER SEEN AN ANIMAL COME BACK TO LIFE
THINKING THAT THE FOREST WAS HAUNTED
THE FOUR FRIENDS
AS OUR FRIEND THE MOUSE KNOWS

THE MUSICAL DONKEY RETOLD BY NIVEDITHA SUBRAMANIAM
AND THEN ONE DAY HE BEGAN TO SING WITH JOY
HE WAS DREAMING HE HAD A THOUSAND CUCUMBERS IN HIS FIELD
WHAT COULD THEY DO
ONE BY ONE THEY JUMPED OUT OF THE FIELD
AND RAN TO THE FARMERS HOUSE
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE FARMER WOKE UP HE WAS NOT ALONE
ALL AROUND HIM WERE CUCUMBERS WIDE AWAKE LOOKING AT HIM
AND IN THE FIELD THE DONKEY WAS FAST ASLEEP
DURING THE DAY THE DONKEY WORKED FOR THE WASHERMAN
AT NIGHT HE WENT FOR LONG WALKS WITH HIS FRIEND THE JACKAL
THE JACKAL NEVER LISTENED BUT THE DONKEY TALKED AND TALKED
UNTIL THEY REACHED THE CUCUMBER FIELD
THEN THE DONKEY WOULD OPEN HIS MOUTH WIDE
AND BITE INTO A FRESH JUICY CUCUMBER
IT WAS AS COOL AS THE MOON
EVERY NIGHT THE TWO ATE
THE DONKEY ATE A LOT
HE GREW FAT WITH JOY
OH NO SAID THE JACKAL AND CLOSED HIS EARS
OH YES SAID THE DONKEY AND OPENED HIS MOUTH EVEN WIDER
STOP CRIED THE JACKAL
THE FARMER WILL HEAR YOU
BUT THE DONKEY DIDNT STOP SINGING
STOP CRIED THE JACKAL
THE CUCUMBERS WILL HEAR YOU
STILL THE DONKEY DIDNT STOP SINGING
BUT THE FARMER DIDNT HEAR HIM
YOU KNOW WHY
HE DIDNT WANT TO WAKE UP
IN THE FIELD THE REAL CUCUMBERS WAITED
BUT THE FARMER DID NOT COME
AND THE MUSICAL DONKEY WOULD NOT STOP SINGING
THE CUCUMBERS COULD NOT BEAR IT

THE WIND AND THE SUN
SO THAT NO ONE CAN SEE YOU
HE WHIPPED AROUND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
LETS JUST SEE WHO CAN TAKE HIS SHAWL OFF
THE WIND HAD BLOWN HIMSELF OUT
AND WIPED THE SWEAT OFF HIS FOREHEAD
SAID THE SUN WITH A TEASING SMILE
THEY LAUGHED TOGETHER AND WATCHED THE MAN WALKING DOWN THE ROAD
AGAIN WHISTLING HAPPILY TO HIMSELF
A SANTALI FOLKTALE
ONE AFTERNOON THE WIND AND THE SUN
WERE HAVING AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHO IS STRONGER
IVE UPROOTED HUGE TREES
AND DROWNED MILIONS OF SHIPS
YOU CANT DO EITHER OF THOSE THINGS
SAID THE WIND PROUDLY
THE SUN SMILED AND SHRUGGED
THAT DOSENT MEAN YOURE MORE POWERFUL HE SAID
I CAN COVER YOU WITH CLOUDS
YOU CANT DO THAT TO ME
SAID THE WIND
BUT THE SUN JUST SMILED WARMLY
I STILL THINK IM STRONGER THAN YOU
HE SAID CALMLY
THE WIND BEGAN TO GRUMBLE
HE DIDNT LIKE THE IDEA
OF THE SUN BEING STRONGER THAN HIM
WHY DONT WE HAVE A TEST
THE WIND FINALLY SUGGESTED
TO SHOW OFF HIS STRENGTH
SHALL WE SEE WHO CAN KNOCK DOWN THE MOST NUMBER OF HOUSES HE ASKED
LETS KEEP IT SIMPLE
SEE THAT MAN OVER THERE ASKED THE SUN
WIND LOOKED DOWN AND SAW A MAN
WALKING DOWN A ROAD
HE WAS WHISTLING HAPPILY TO HIMSELF
AND HAD A SHAWL THROWN ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS
SHALL WE SEE WHO CAN FORCE HIM OFF THE ROAD FIRST THE WIND ASKED
NO THAT WILL ONLY HURT HIM THE SUN REPLIED
THE WIND SHRUGGED AND WHIPPED AROUND THE SKY
HE HUFFED AND PUFFED
AND MADE THE LEAVES IN THE TREES SHIVER
THE MAN FROWNED AT THE SKY
AND WRAPPED HIS SHAWL TIGHTLY AROUND HIMSELF
THUNDER CLOUDS APPEARED IN THE SKY
ANIMALS BEGAN RUNNING FOR SHELTER
AND THE WIND BEGAN TO ROAR
THE MAN WRAPPED HIS SHAWL EVEN TIGHTER
SOON THE THUNDERCLOUDS DRIFTED AWAY
I GIVE UP I CANT DO IT
PANTED THE WIND
HE CURLED UP ON TOP OF A CLOUD TO CATCH HIS BREATH
NOW ITS MY TURN SAID THE SUN
HE YAWNED LAZILY
AND STRETCHED HIS RAYS
HE SEEMED TO GROW BRIGHTER
AND BIGGER IN THE SKY
SOON IT WAS AS HOT AS A SUMMER DAY
THE MAN LOOKED UP AT THE SKY
WHAT STRANGE WEATHER WERE HAVING TODAY
HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THEN HE TOOK HIS SHAWL OFF AND TUCKED IT UNDER HIS ARM
LOOKS LIKE YOU WIN
THE WIND AGREED CHEERFULLY
HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND MADE THE LEAVES ON THE TREES RUSTLE
YOU DONT HAVE TO KNOCK A MAN DOWN
TO TAKE HIS SHAWL OFF
VAYU THE WIND BY MADHURAI BAI
VAYU THE WIND
WHO MAKES IT HAPPEN
WHO MAKES THAT HAPPEN
VAYU THE WIND
CANNOT BE SEEN CANNOT BE HEARD
DOES ALL THE WORK WITHOUT A WORD
WHO CAN IT BE
OF COURSE THE WIND
EVERY TIME I FINISH MY HOT HOT BATH
MY WET BODY FEELS SO COOL COOL COOL
WHO MAKES THAT HAPPEN
VAYU THE WIND
THE MILK IN MY CUP TOO HOT TOO HOT
BUT SOON IT IS READY FOR ME TO GULP
WHO MAKES THAT HAPPEN
VAYU THE WIND
THE WINDOW CURTAINS FLUTTER AND GENTLY BRUSH MY FACE
WHO MAKES IT HAPPEN
A BOLT OF LIGHTNING FAR AWAY
BLACK CLOUDS MOVING MY WAY
WHO MAKES THAT HAPPEN
VAYU THE WIND
BRANCHES SWAY AND LEAVES TREMBLE
FLOWERS GENTLY FALL
WHO DID IT ALL
VAYU THE WIND
FAR FROM THE HOUSE WE ARE PLAYING
YET I CAN SMELL THE SWEETS MOTHER IS PREPARING
VAYU THE WIND
A GLASS TUMBLER ON A WINDOW SILL CRASHES ON THE GROUND
THANK GOD I WAS NOT AROUND
WHO PLAYED THIS MISCHIEF
OF COURSE IT WAS VAYU THE WIND
A WHISTLE BLOWS A TRAIN ROLLS IN
I CANNOT SEE BUT HEAR ITS DIN
