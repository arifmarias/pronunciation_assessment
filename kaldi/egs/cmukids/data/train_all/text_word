THE FLYING ELEPHANT A BHILI FOLKTALE
GROW LARGER IN THE SKY
THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH SILVER GRASS AND PRECIOUS STONES
AND BECAME A VERY RICH MAN
AND SURE ENOUGH THE ELEPHANT FLEW DOWN ONE NIGHT
BUT INDRA HEARING OF THE VILLAGERS TRICK
THE ELEPHANT NEVER FELT THE NEED TO FLY DOWN AGAIN
THE VILLAGERS WAITED FOR MANY NIGHTS WATCHING THE SKY
BUT THE ELEPHANT NEVER CAME BACK DOWN AGAIN
A SUGARCANE FARMER ONCE LIVED IN A SMALL VILLAGE
HE WORKED VERY HARD IN HIS FIELDS
AND HOPED TO HAVE A BIG HARVEST
ONE MORNING HE SAW THAT A BIG CHUNK OF HIS CROP WAS MISSING
THE NEXT DAY ANOTHER HUGE CHUNK OF HIS CROP WAS GONE
ILL STAY AWAKE TONIGHT
AND SEE WHO IS EATING MY SUGARCANE
THE FARMER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
THAT NIGHT HE WAITED BY THE WINDOW WATCHING HIS FIELDS
AS THE MOON ROSE HE SAW A TINY SPECK
IT WAS AN ELEPHANT FLYING RIGHT INTO HIS FIELD
THE FARMER WATCHED IN AMAZEMENT
AS IT FLEW DOWN AND STARTED EATING HIS SUGARCANE
HE TIPTOED OUTSIDE AND WAITED FOR THE ELEPHANT TO FINISH EATING
WHEN THE ELEPHANT BEGAN FLYING AWAY
THE FARMER GRABBED ITS TAIL
IN ORDER TO CATCH THE ELEPHANT
SOON HE WAS FLYING ABOVE HIS FIELDS
INTO INDRAS KINGDOM OF PARADISE
PARADISE WAS FILLED WITH BEAUTIFUL BIRDS AND FLOWERS
THE FARMER SOON FOUND THE ROYAL PALACE AND MET INDRA
YOUR ELEPHANT HAS BEEN FLYING DOWN AND EATING ALL MY SUGARCANE
MY HARVEST IS RUINED SAID THE FARMER
I AM VERY SORRY
PLEASE TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT FROM MY KINGDOM
ILL MAKE SURE HE DOSENT GO DOWN AGAIN
AND DAMAGE YOUR CROPS SAID INDRA
AND BLESSED THE MAN WITH A SAFE JOURNEY BACK HOME
THE FARMER TOOK TWO HANDFULS OF GEMS AND RETURNED HOME
HE BUILT HIMSELF A NEW HOUSE
SOON THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT HIS SUDDEN WEALTH
ONE DAY SOME VILLAGERS WENT TO VISIT THE FARMERS WIFE
WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THIS MONEY
DID YOU FIND BURIED TREASURE IN YOUR FIELDS THEY ASKED
THE FARMERS WIFE TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPEND
THAT EVENING THE VILLAGERS DECIDED
TO LURE THE ELEPHANT DOWN THEMSELVES
WHEN WE GET TO PARADISE WELL TAKE MORE THAN
JUST TWO HANDFULS OF GEMS THEY SAID
THEY PLANTED A FIELD OF SUGARCANE
ONE VILLAGER GRABBED ITS TAIL AND SOON
THERE WAS A CHAIN OF VILLAGERS FLYING BEHIND THE ELEPHANT
AS THEY FLEW UP
THEY BEGAN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD BRING BACK
FINALLY IT WAS THE TURN OF THE VILLAGER HOLDING THE ELEPHANTS TAIL
IM GOING TO CARRY BACK THIS MANY GEMS HE DECLARED IN EXCITMENT
HE STRETCHED HIS ARMS WIDE AND LET GO OF THE ELEPHANTS TAIL
THE VILLAGERS ALL FELL IN A HEAP ON THE GROUND
THEY WATCHED SADLY AS THE THE ELEPHANT DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY
DONT WORRY THE ELEPHANT WILL COME BACK TOMORROW SAID THE VILLAGERS
ARRANGED FOR A SUGARCANE FIELD TO BE PLANTED IN PARADISE
THE FOUR FRIENDS
AS OUR FRIEND THE MOUSE KNOWS
FREE AT LAST THE DOVES FLEW AWAY
THE CROW FLEW IN EVERY DIRECTION LOOKING FOR HER
WHY DID YOU COME HERE
SHE LAY DOWN ABSOLUTELY STILL
HE RAN FOR HIS LIFE
THE FOUR FRIENDS CAME BACK HOME
AND WERE HAPPY TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN
RETOLD BY BOOKBOX
FAR FROM ANY TOWN THERE WAS A FOREST
IN WHICH ALL THE ANIMALS AND BIRDS LIVED TOGETHER PEACEFULLY
THE FOREST WAS HOME TO FOUR INSEPARABLE FRIENDS
A DEER A TORTOISE A CROW AND A MOUSE
EVERY EVENING THEY MET TO DISCUSS THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
BUT ONE DAY THE DEER BECAME VERY FRIGHTENED
HUNTERS ARE LAYING TRAPS EVERYWHERE
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ESCAPE
YES THERE IS THE CROW CRIED OUT
THE CROW BEGAN TELLING WHAT HE HAD SEEN
JUST THE OTHER DAY I SAW THE MOST AMAZING THING
A FLOCK OF DOVES GOT TRAPPED IN A HUNTERS NET
THEIR WINGS FLAPPING WILDLY
THEN SUDDENLY ALL TOGETHER
THE DOVES PICKED UP THE NET
IN THEIR BEAKS AND FLEW INTO THE SKY
AND WHERE DID THEY GO
STRAIGHT TO OUR FRIEND THE MOUSE
WITH HIS SHARP TEETH HE TORE THE NET TO PIECES
THEY WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO OUR FRIEND
AFTER THE STORY ENDED
THE DEER WENT IN SEARCH OF WATER
MEANWHILE THE THREE FRIENDS STARTED NIBBLING
ON THE FRUITS SHRUBHS AND THE LEAVES OF THE FOREST
THEY CHATTED LATE INTO THE NIGHT
STILL WAITING FOR THE DEER TO RETURN
BUT THE DEER WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
AND THE FRIENDS BEGAN TO WORRY
AT DAWN WHILE THE OTHERS CALLED OUT TO THE DEER
IN A CLEARING HE SPOTTED THE DEER
WITH HER FOOT CAUGHT IN A NET
DONT WORRY HE TOLD HER CALMLY
WE WILL THINK OF SOMETHING
THE CROW RUSHED BACK TO HIS FRIENDS
THE TORTOISE HAD AN IDEA
MOUSE HOP QUICKLY ON THE CROWS BACK
AND THEY FLEW OFF TO RESCUE THE DEER
WITHOUT WASTING TIME THE MOUSE BIT THROUGH THE NET
JUST THEN THE ANXIOUS TORTOISE REACHED THE SPOT
IF THE HUNTER RETURNS YOU WILL NEVER ESCAPE THE DEER EXCLAIMED
AND THE HUNTER DID RETURN
HEARING HIS FOOTSTEPS
ALL OF THEM RAN AWAY
BUT THE TORTOISE WAS TOO SLOW
THE HUNTER PICKED HIM UP AND TIED HIM TO A STICK
OH NO BECAUSE OF ME POOR TORTOISE IS IN TROUBLE
SAID THE DEER
SUDDENLY THE DEER LEAPED UP
AND RAN TO THE POND NEAR THE PATH
WHILE THE CROW PECKED AT HER
WHEN THE HUNTER DROPPED THE TORTOISE AND PICKED UP THE DEER
THE MOUSE QUICKLY CUT THE CHORDS
AND RELEASED THE TORTOISE
WHILE THE TORTOISE SLIPPED INTO THE WATER
THE DEER DARTED OFF
AND THE CROW SIMPLY FLEW AWAY
THE HUNTER TREMBLED WITH FEAR
HE HAD NEVER SEEN AN ANIMAL COME BACK TO LIFE
THINKING THAT THE FOREST WAS HAUNTED
THE LION AND THE FOX RETOLD BY DEEPA BALSAGAR
FINALLY SHE FOUND A MAN STANDING NEXT TO A PILE OF LOGS
THEY STARTED DISCUSSING HOW THEY WOULD SHARE THE FOOD
IF HE DID WOULD HE CUT ALL THE TREES
AND DESTROY THE FOREST
UP ON THE TREE THE MAN NODDED SADLY
THE FOX WAS RIGHT
HE HAD BEEN LOOKING AROUND FOR TREES TO JUMP ON TO AND RUN AWAY
BUT THERE WERE NONE NEARBY
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A THICK GREEN FOREST
WHERE THE ANIMALS HAD PLENTY TO EAT
THEN CAME MEN WITH MACHINES
AND THEY STARTED CHOPPING DOWN THE TREES
FEWER TREES MEAN FEWER ANIMALS
SOON THE MIGHTY LION FOUND THAT THERE WAS HARDLY ANYTHING LEFT TO EAT
WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER HE SAID TO HIS FRIEND THE FOX
YOU FIND AN ANIMAL AND BRING IT TO ME
I WILL KILL IT AND THEN WE CAN BOTH EAT IT
THE FOX SEARCHED AND SEARCHED
THERE ARE BIGGER AND BETTER TREES ON THE OTHERSIDE OF THE FOREST
THE FOX SAID TO HIM
WHERE WHERE SHOW ME SAID THE GREEDY MAN
SO THE FOX LED THE MAN HERE AND THERE
AND ROUND AND ROUND THE FOREST AND TO WHERE
THE LION WAS WAITING
THE LION LEAPT TOWARDS THE MAN
THE MAN SHOT UP THE CLOSEST TREE JUST LIKE A MONKEY
THE LION AND THE FOX WERE NOT TOO WORRIED
THEY KNEW THE MAN COULD NOT ESCAPE
ILL START WITH THE TOES SAID THE LION
ILL START WITH THE FINGERS SAID THE FOX
ONE BY ONE THEY CHOSE WHO WOULD EAT WHAT
FINALLY THE LION LICKED HIS LIPS AND SAID
I WILL EAT THE BRAIN MMMMM
NOW THE FOX HAD ALSO BEEN DREAMING ABOUT EATING THE MANS BRAIN
SHE TOLD THE LION
BUT THIS ANIMAL HAS NO BRAIN
THE MUSICAL DONKEY RETOLD BY NIVEDITHA SUBRAMANIAM
AND THEN ONE DAY HE BEGAN TO SING WITH JOY
HE WAS DREAMING HE HAD A THOUSAND CUCUMBERS IN HIS FIELD
WHAT COULD THEY DO
ONE BY ONE THEY JUMPED OUT OF THE FIELD
AND RAN TO THE FARMERS HOUSE
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE FARMER WOKE UP HE WAS NOT ALONE
ALL AROUND HIM WERE CUCUMBERS WIDE AWAKE LOOKING AT HIM
AND IN THE FIELD THE DONKEY WAS FAST ASLEEP
DURING THE DAY THE DONKEY WORKED FOR THE WASHERMAN
AT NIGHT HE WENT FOR LONG WALKS WITH HIS FRIEND THE JACKAL
THE JACKAL NEVER LISTENED BUT THE DONKEY TALKED AND TALKED
UNTIL THEY REACHED THE CUCUMBER FIELD
THEN THE DONKEY WOULD OPEN HIS MOUTH WIDE
AND BITE INTO A FRESH JUICY CUCUMBER
IT WAS AS COOL AS THE MOON
EVERY NIGHT THE TWO ATE
THE DONKEY ATE A LOT
HE GREW FAT WITH JOY
OH NO SAID THE JACKAL AND CLOSED HIS EARS
OH YES SAID THE DONKEY AND OPENED HIS MOUTH EVEN WIDER
STOP CRIED THE JACKAL
THE FARMER WILL HEAR YOU
BUT THE DONKEY DIDNT STOP SINGING
STOP CRIED THE JACKAL
THE CUCUMBERS WILL HEAR YOU
STILL THE DONKEY DIDNT STOP SINGING
BUT THE FARMER DIDNT HEAR HIM
YOU KNOW WHY
HE DIDNT WANT TO WAKE UP
IN THE FIELD THE REAL CUCUMBERS WAITED
BUT THE FARMER DID NOT COME
AND THE MUSICAL DONKEY WOULD NOT STOP SINGING
THE CUCUMBERS COULD NOT BEAR IT
THE MUSICAL DONKEY RETOLD BY NIVEDITHA SUBRAMANIAM

DURING THE DAY THE DONKEY WORKED FOR THE WASHERMAN
AT NIGHT HE WENT FOR LONG WALKS WITH HIS FRIEND THE JACKAL
THE JACKAL NEVER LISTENED BUT THE DONKEY TALKED AND TALKED
UNTIL THEY REACHED THE CUCUMBER FIELD
THEN THE DONKEY WOULD OPEN HIS MOUTH WIDE
AND BITE INTO A FRESH JUICY CUCUMBER
IT WAS AS COOL AS THE MOON
EVERY NIGHT THE TWO ATE
THE DONKEY ATE A LOT
HE GREW FAT WITH JOY
OH NO SAID THE JACKAL AND CLOSED HIS EARS
OH YES SAID THE DONKEY AND OPENED HIS MOUTH EVEN WIDER
STOP CRIED THE JACKAL
THE FARMER WILL HEAR YOU
BUT THE DONKEY DIDNT STOP SINGING
STOP CRIED THE JACKAL
THE CUCUMBERS WILL HEAR YOU
STILL THE DONKEY DIDNT STOP SINGING
BUT THE FARMER DIDNT HEAR HIM
YOU KNOW WHY
HE DIDNT WANT TO WAKE UP
IN THE FIELD THE REAL CUCUMBERS WAITED
BUT THE FARMER DID NOT COME
AND THE MUSICAL DONKEY WOULD NOT STOP SINGING
THE CUCUMBERS COULD NOT BEAR IT

MANY NATIVE AMERICANS ARE TRYING TODAY TO KEEP THEIR /T R ER D IH ZH IX N Z/ ALIVE
THEY LIVE IN HOMES LIKE OTHER AMERICANS AND THEY GO TO THE SAME SCHOOLS
FREE TIME THEY ENJOY THE SAME GAMES AND T V PROGRAMS [NOISE] THAT EVERY ELSE DOES EVERYONE ELSE DOES
MANY NATIVE AMERICAN CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT TRADITIONS [NOISE] THAT PEOPLE IN THEIR FAMILIES [NOISE] HAVE HAD FOR MANY GENERATIONS
LEARN SONGS STORIES AND DANCES
THEY ALSO LEARN ABOUT SPECIAL FOODS AND ARTWORK
[NOISE] AND THEY SOMETIMES LEARN TO SPEAK A NATIVE AMERICAN LANGUAGE
SOME PEOPLE WORK EXTRA HARD TO BE SURE THEY [NOISE] THEIR TRADITIONS ARE NOT FORGOTTEN
THEY TRAVEL EVERYWHERE TEACHING OTHERS ABOUT THESE TRADITIONS
ONE NATIVE AMERICAN TRADITION IS TOTEM POLE CARVING
[NOISE] OFTEN PEOPLE PASS THIS TRADITION DOWN TO THEIR CHILDREN
CHILDREN WATCHED THE FATHERS AND SOME [NOISE] TIMES THEIR GRANDFATHERS AND GREAT GRANDFATHERS CARVE TOTEM POLES
FIRST THEY FIND A TREE THAT CAN BE CUT
THEY REMOVE THE BARK FROM THE TREE AND MAKE IT INTO A POLE
THEN THEY DRAW THE FACES AND OTHER MARKINGS ON THE POLE
SHARP TOOLS ARE USED TO CARVE THE POLE
[NOISE] THEY START AT THE TOP OF THE POLE AND CARVE DOWN /W AO R D/ TO THE BOTTOM
[NOISE] WHEN THE [BEGIN NOISE] /K AA R V/ [END NOISE] /IX NG/ IS FINISHED THE POLE IS PAINTED [NOISE]
THEN OIL IS SPREAD ALL OVER THE POLE
THE OIL IS USED TO KEEP THE POLE FROM CRACKING
[NOISE] IT TAKES ONE MONTH TO CARVE ABOUT TEN FEET OF OF POLE [NOISE]
IF THERE ARE A LOT OF SYMBOLS IT MAY TAKE LONGER
[NOISE] MOST TOTEM POLES ARE BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY FEET HIGH
A FAMILY TOTEM POLE [NOISE] MAY BE AS HIGH AS NINETY FEET
MANY ANIMAL SIGNS CAN BE FOUND ON THESE POLES [NOISE] AS PART OF THE FAMILYS HISTORY
SOMETIMES THESE ANIMALS STAND FOR DANCES THAT PEOPLE IN THE FAMILY LIKED TO DO
[NOISE] AT PRESENT TOTEM POLES [NOISE] ARE SOLD TO PEOPLE [NOISE] WHO COLLECT THEM AND [NOISE] TO MUSEUMS
[NOISE] THERE WAS A [BEGIN NOISE] CRIME [END NOISE] IN [BEGIN NOISE] ALASKA [END NOISE] WHERE SOMEONE WAS ROBBED AND HARMED

[NOISE] AFTER THAT AMERICANS WON A FIRST [NOISE] WHEN NEIL ARMSTRONG WALKED ON THE MOON
[NOISE] THE WORK NEEDED TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS HAS COST THE PEOPLE [NOISE] OF THE TWO COUNTRIES MUCH MONEY
NOW THEY CANNOT SPEND THESE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY FOR SPACE RESEARCH
BECAUSE OF THIS THE U S AND RUSSIA WILL NOW COMBINE THEIR EFFORTS [NOISE] WITH SCIENTISTS OF MANY COUNTRIES
[NOISE] THEY WILL BUILD A SPACE STATION [NOISE] WHERE ASTRONAUTS FROM AROUND THE WORLD [NOISE] WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE AND WORK
[NOISE] LIFE ON SPACE STATION IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE ARE USED TO
[NOISE] MOST OF THE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE THERE ISNT MUCH GRAVITY IN OUTER SPACE
[NOISE] THE FORCE OF GRAVITY ATTRACTS THINGS [NOISE] TO THE /ER S/ SURFACE
[NOISE] WITHOUT GRAVITY ON EARTH YOU [NOISE] WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO WALK
YOU MIGHT BOUNCE OR YOU WOULD FLOAT
[NOISE] GRAVITY CAUSES SEVERAL PROBLEMS IN SPACE
[NOISE] ASTRONAUTS DONT EAT FOOD THAT MAKES CRUMBS [NOISE] SINCE THEY WOULD FLOAT AROUND THE SPACE /SH/ STATION
[NOISE] THEY USE A VACUUM CLEANERS TO GET RID OF ANY CRUMBS
DROPS OF WATER IN A SHOWER ARE ALSO A PROBLEM
THEY HAVE A SHOWER ROOM WITH A DOOR THAT CLOSES AND A VACUUM CLEANER [NOISE] TO GET WATER OFF THEIR BODIES [NOISE] AFTER THEY ARE FINISHED
[NOISE] ASTRONAUTS STRAP THEIR FEET TO THE FLOOR WHEN THEY USE THE TOILET [NOISE] OR THE SHOWER

THE FLYING ELEPHANT A BHILI FOLKTALE
GROW LARGER IN THE SKY
THE GROUND WAS COVERED WITH SILVER GRASS AND PRECIOUS STONES
AND BECAME A VERY RICH MAN
AND SURE ENOUGH THE ELEPHANT FLEW DOWN ONE NIGHT
BUT INDRA HEARING OF THE VILLAGERS TRICK
THE ELEPHANT NEVER FELT THE NEED TO FLY DOWN AGAIN
THE VILLAGERS WAITED FOR MANY NIGHTS WATCHING THE SKY
BUT THE ELEPHANT NEVER CAME BACK DOWN AGAIN
A SUGARCANE FARMER ONCE LIVED IN A SMALL VILLAGE
HE WORKED VERY HARD IN HIS FIELDS
AND HOPED TO HAVE A BIG HARVEST
ONE MORNING HE SAW THAT A BIG CHUNK OF HIS CROP WAS MISSING
THE NEXT DAY ANOTHER HUGE CHUNK OF HIS CROP WAS GONE
ILL STAY AWAKE TONIGHT
AND SEE WHO IS EATING MY SUGARCANE
THE FARMER THOUGHT TO HIMSELF
THAT NIGHT HE WAITED BY THE WINDOW WATCHING HIS FIELDS
AS THE MOON ROSE HE SAW A TINY SPECK
IT WAS AN ELEPHANT FLYING RIGHT INTO HIS FIELD
THE FARMER WATCHED IN AMAZEMENT
AS IT FLEW DOWN AND STARTED EATING HIS SUGARCANE
HE TIPTOED OUTSIDE AND WAITED FOR THE ELEPHANT TO FINISH EATING
WHEN THE ELEPHANT BEGAN FLYING AWAY
THE FARMER GRABBED ITS TAIL
IN ORDER TO CATCH THE ELEPHANT
SOON HE WAS FLYING ABOVE HIS FIELDS
INTO INDRAS KINGDOM OF PARADISE
PARADISE WAS FILLED WITH BEAUTIFUL BIRDS AND FLOWERS
THE FARMER SOON FOUND THE ROYAL PALACE AND MET INDRA
YOUR ELEPHANT HAS BEEN FLYING DOWN AND EATING ALL MY SUGARCANE
MY HARVEST IS RUINED SAID THE FARMER
I AM VERY SORRY
PLEASE TAKE WHATEVER YOU WANT FROM MY KINGDOM
ILL MAKE SURE HE DOSENT GO DOWN AGAIN
AND DAMAGE YOUR CROPS SAID INDRA
AND BLESSED THE MAN WITH A SAFE JOURNEY BACK HOME
THE FARMER TOOK TWO HANDFULS OF GEMS AND RETURNED HOME
HE BUILT HIMSELF A NEW HOUSE
SOON THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS CURIOUS ABOUT HIS SUDDEN WEALTH
ONE DAY SOME VILLAGERS WENT TO VISIT THE FARMERS WIFE
WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THIS MONEY
DID YOU FIND BURIED TREASURE IN YOUR FIELDS THEY ASKED
THE FARMERS WIFE TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPEND
THAT EVENING THE VILLAGERS DECIDED
TO LURE THE ELEPHANT DOWN THEMSELVES
WHEN WE GET TO PARADISE WELL TAKE MORE THAN
JUST TWO HANDFULS OF GEMS THEY SAID
THEY PLANTED A FIELD OF SUGARCANE
ONE VILLAGER GRABBED ITS TAIL AND SOON
THERE WAS A CHAIN OF VILLAGERS FLYING BEHIND THE ELEPHANT
AS THEY FLEW UP
THEY BEGAN TALKING ABOUT WHAT THEY WOULD BRING BACK
FINALLY IT WAS THE TURN OF THE VILLAGER HOLDING THE ELEPHANTS TAIL
IM GOING TO CARRY BACK THIS MANY GEMS HE DECLARED IN EXCITMENT
HE STRETCHED HIS ARMS WIDE AND LET GO OF THE ELEPHANTS TAIL
THE VILLAGERS ALL FELL IN A HEAP ON THE GROUND
THEY WATCHED SADLY AS THE THE ELEPHANT DISAPPEARED INTO THE SKY
DONT WORRY THE ELEPHANT WILL COME BACK TOMORROW SAID THE VILLAGERS
ARRANGED FOR A SUGARCANE FIELD TO BE PLANTED IN PARADISE
THE FOUR FRIENDS
AS OUR FRIEND THE MOUSE KNOWS
FREE AT LAST THE DOVES FLEW AWAY
THE CROW FLEW IN EVERY DIRECTION LOOKING FOR HER
WHY DID YOU COME HERE
SHE LAY DOWN ABSOLUTELY STILL
HE RAN FOR HIS LIFE
THE FOUR FRIENDS CAME BACK HOME
AND WERE HAPPY TO BE TOGETHER AGAIN
RETOLD BY BOOKBOX
FAR FROM ANY TOWN THERE WAS A FOREST
IN WHICH ALL THE ANIMALS AND BIRDS LIVED TOGETHER PEACEFULLY
THE FOREST WAS HOME TO FOUR INSEPARABLE FRIENDS
A DEER A TORTOISE A CROW AND A MOUSE
EVERY EVENING THEY MET TO DISCUSS THE EVENTS OF THE DAY
BUT ONE DAY THE DEER BECAME VERY FRIGHTENED
HUNTERS ARE LAYING TRAPS EVERYWHERE
IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO ESCAPE
YES THERE IS THE CROW CRIED OUT
THE CROW BEGAN TELLING WHAT HE HAD SEEN
JUST THE OTHER DAY I SAW THE MOST AMAZING THING
A FLOCK OF DOVES GOT TRAPPED IN A HUNTERS NET
THEIR WINGS FLAPPING WILDLY
THEN SUDDENLY ALL TOGETHER
THE DOVES PICKED UP THE NET
IN THEIR BEAKS AND FLEW INTO THE SKY
AND WHERE DID THEY GO
STRAIGHT TO OUR FRIEND THE MOUSE
WITH HIS SHARP TEETH HE TORE THE NET TO PIECES
THEY WERE VERY GRATEFUL TO OUR FRIEND
AFTER THE STORY ENDED
THE DEER WENT IN SEARCH OF WATER
MEANWHILE THE THREE FRIENDS STARTED NIBBLING
ON THE FRUITS SHRUBHS AND THE LEAVES OF THE FOREST
THEY CHATTED LATE INTO THE NIGHT
STILL WAITING FOR THE DEER TO RETURN
BUT THE DEER WAS NOWHERE TO BE SEEN
AND THE FRIENDS BEGAN TO WORRY
AT DAWN WHILE THE OTHERS CALLED OUT TO THE DEER
IN A CLEARING HE SPOTTED THE DEER
WITH HER FOOT CAUGHT IN A NET
DONT WORRY HE TOLD HER CALMLY
WE WILL THINK OF SOMETHING
THE CROW RUSHED BACK TO HIS FRIENDS
THE TORTOISE HAD AN IDEA
MOUSE HOP QUICKLY ON THE CROWS BACK
AND THEY FLEW OFF TO RESCUE THE DEER
WITHOUT WASTING TIME THE MOUSE BIT THROUGH THE NET
JUST THEN THE ANXIOUS TORTOISE REACHED THE SPOT
IF THE HUNTER RETURNS YOU WILL NEVER ESCAPE THE DEER EXCLAIMED
AND THE HUNTER DID RETURN
HEARING HIS FOOTSTEPS
ALL OF THEM RAN AWAY
BUT THE TORTOISE WAS TOO SLOW
THE HUNTER PICKED HIM UP AND TIED HIM TO A STICK
OH NO BECAUSE OF ME POOR TORTOISE IS IN TROUBLE
SAID THE DEER
SUDDENLY THE DEER LEAPED UP
AND RAN TO THE POND NEAR THE PATH
WHILE THE CROW PECKED AT HER
WHEN THE HUNTER DROPPED THE TORTOISE AND PICKED UP THE DEER
THE MOUSE QUICKLY CUT THE CHORDS
AND RELEASED THE TORTOISE
WHILE THE TORTOISE SLIPPED INTO THE WATER
THE DEER DARTED OFF
AND THE CROW SIMPLY FLEW AWAY
THE HUNTER TREMBLED WITH FEAR
HE HAD NEVER SEEN AN ANIMAL COME BACK TO LIFE
THINKING THAT THE FOREST WAS HAUNTED
THE FOUR FRIENDS
AS OUR FRIEND THE MOUSE KNOWS

THINKING THAT THE FOREST WAS HAUNTED
THE MUSICAL DONKEY RETOLD BY NIVEDITHA SUBRAMANIAM
AND THEN ONE DAY HE BEGAN TO SING WITH JOY
HE WAS DREAMING HE HAD A THOUSAND CUCUMBERS IN HIS FIELD
WHAT COULD THEY DO
ONE BY ONE THEY JUMPED OUT OF THE FIELD
AND RAN TO THE FARMERS HOUSE
THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE FARMER WOKE UP HE WAS NOT ALONE
ALL AROUND HIM WERE CUCUMBERS WIDE AWAKE LOOKING AT HIM
AND IN THE FIELD THE DONKEY WAS FAST ASLEEP
DURING THE DAY THE DONKEY WORKED FOR THE WASHERMAN
AT NIGHT HE WENT FOR LONG WALKS WITH HIS FRIEND THE JACKAL
THE JACKAL NEVER LISTENED BUT THE DONKEY TALKED AND TALKED
UNTIL THEY REACHED THE CUCUMBER FIELD
THEN THE DONKEY WOULD OPEN HIS MOUTH WIDE
AND BITE INTO A FRESH JUICY CUCUMBER
IT WAS AS COOL AS THE MOON
EVERY NIGHT THE TWO ATE
THE DONKEY ATE A LOT
HE GREW FAT WITH JOY
OH NO SAID THE JACKAL AND CLOSED HIS EARS
OH YES SAID THE DONKEY AND OPENED HIS MOUTH EVEN WIDER
STOP CRIED THE JACKAL
THE FARMER WILL HEAR YOU
BUT THE DONKEY DIDNT STOP SINGING
STOP CRIED THE JACKAL
THE CUCUMBERS WILL HEAR YOU
STILL THE DONKEY DIDNT STOP SINGING
BUT THE FARMER DIDNT HEAR HIM
YOU KNOW WHY
HE DIDNT WANT TO WAKE UP
IN THE FIELD THE REAL CUCUMBERS WAITED
BUT THE FARMER DID NOT COME
AND THE MUSICAL DONKEY WOULD NOT STOP SINGING
THE CUCUMBERS COULD NOT BEAR IT

BUT YOU MUST KEEP YOU MOUTH SHUT
AND NOT TALK AT ALL
BUT BUT I DONT HAVE WINGS I SAID
GANGA HELD ONE END
YAMUNA HELD THE OTHER
I HELD THE MIDDLE
THE WIND AND THE SUN
SO THAT NO ONE CAN SEE YOU
HE WHIPPED AROUND LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
LETS JUST SEE WHO CAN TAKE HIS SHAWL OFF
THE WIND HAD BLOWN HIMSELF OUT
AND WIPED THE SWEAT OFF HIS FOREHEAD
SAID THE SUN WITH A TEASING SMILE
THEY LAUGHED TOGETHER AND WATCHED THE MAN WALKING DOWN THE ROAD
AGAIN WHISTLING HAPPILY TO HIMSELF
A SANTALI FOLKTALE
ONE AFTERNOON THE WIND AND THE SUN
WERE HAVING AN ARGUMENT ABOUT WHO IS STRONGER
IVE UPROOTED HUGE TREES
AND DROWNED MILIONS OF SHIPS
YOU CANT DO EITHER OF THOSE THINGS
SAID THE WIND PROUDLY
THE SUN SMILED AND SHRUGGED
THAT DOSENT MEAN YOURE MORE POWERFUL HE SAID
I CAN COVER YOU WITH CLOUDS
YOU CANT DO THAT TO ME
SAID THE WIND
BUT THE SUN JUST SMILED WARMLY
I STILL THINK IM STRONGER THAN YOU
HE SAID CALMLY
THE WIND BEGAN TO GRUMBLE
HE DIDNT LIKE THE IDEA
OF THE SUN BEING STRONGER THAN HIM
WHY DONT WE HAVE A TEST
THE WIND FINALLY SUGGESTED
TO SHOW OFF HIS STRENGTH
SHALL WE SEE WHO CAN KNOCK DOWN THE MOST NUMBER OF HOUSES HE ASKED
LETS KEEP IT SIMPLE
SEE THAT MAN OVER THERE ASKED THE SUN
WIND LOOKED DOWN AND SAW A MAN
WALKING DOWN A ROAD
HE WAS WHISTLING HAPPILY TO HIMSELF
AND HAD A SHAWL THROWN ACROSS HIS SHOULDERS
SHALL WE SEE WHO CAN FORCE HIM OFF THE ROAD FIRST THE WIND ASKED
NO THAT WILL ONLY HURT HIM THE SUN REPLIED
THE WIND SHRUGGED AND WHIPPED AROUND THE SKY
HE HUFFED AND PUFFED
AND MADE THE LEAVES IN THE TREES SHIVER
THE MAN FROWNED AT THE SKY
AND WRAPPED HIS SHAWL TIGHTLY AROUND HIMSELF
THUNDER CLOUDS APPEARED IN THE SKY
ANIMALS BEGAN RUNNING FOR SHELTER
AND THE WIND BEGAN TO ROAR
THE MAN WRAPPED HIS SHAWL EVEN TIGHTER
SOON THE THUNDERCLOUDS DRIFTED AWAY
I GIVE UP I CANT DO IT
PANTED THE WIND
HE CURLED UP ON TOP OF A CLOUD TO CATCH HIS BREATH
NOW ITS MY TURN SAID THE SUN
HE YAWNED LAZILY
AND STRETCHED HIS RAYS
HE SEEMED TO GROW BRIGHTER
AND BIGGER IN THE SKY
SOON IT WAS AS HOT AS A SUMMER DAY
THE MAN LOOKED UP AT THE SKY
WHAT STRANGE WEATHER WERE HAVING TODAY
HE SAID TO HIMSELF
THEN HE TOOK HIS SHAWL OFF AND TUCKED IT UNDER HIS ARM
LOOKS LIKE YOU WIN
THE WIND AGREED CHEERFULLY
HE CLAPPED HIS HANDS AND MADE THE LEAVES ON THE TREES RUSTLE
YOU DONT HAVE TO KNOCK A MAN DOWN
TO TAKE HIS SHAWL OFF
VAYU THE WIND BY MADHURAI BAI
VAYU THE WIND
WHO MAKES IT HAPPEN
WHO MAKES THAT HAPPEN
VAYU THE WIND
CANNOT BE SEEN CANNOT BE HEARD
DOES ALL THE WORK WITHOUT A WORD
WHO CAN IT BE
OF COURSE THE WIND
EVERY TIME I FINISH MY HOT HOT BATH
MY WET BODY FEELS SO COOL COOL COOL
WHO MAKES THAT HAPPEN
VAYU THE WIND
THE MILK IN MY CUP TOO HOT TOO HOT
BUT SOON IT IS READY FOR ME TO GULP
WHO MAKES THAT HAPPEN
VAYU THE WIND
THE WINDOW CURTAINS FLUTTER AND GENTLY BRUSH MY FACE
WHO MAKES IT HAPPEN
A BOLT OF LIGHTNING FAR AWAY
BLACK CLOUDS MOVING MY WAY
WHO MAKES THAT HAPPEN
VAYU THE WIND
BRANCHES SWAY AND LEAVES TREMBLE
FLOWERS GENTLY FALL
WHO DID IT ALL
VAYU THE WIND
FAR FROM THE HOUSE WE ARE PLAYING
YET I CAN SMELL THE SWEETS MOTHER IS PREPARING
VAYU THE WIND
A GLASS TUMBLER ON A WINDOW SILL CRASHES ON THE GROUND
THANK GOD I WAS NOT AROUND
WHO PLAYED THIS MISCHIEF
OF COURSE IT WAS VAYU THE WIND
A WHISTLE BLOWS A TRAIN ROLLS IN
I CANNOT SEE BUT HEAR ITS DIN

[NOISE] LIFE ON SPACE STATION IS VERY DIFFERENT [NOISE] FROM WHAT WE ARE USED TO [NOISE]
MOST OF THE DIFFERENCE IS BECAUSE [NOISE] THERE ISNT MUCH GRAVITY IN /AA R AH DX AXR/ SPACE [NOISE]
[NOISE] THE FORCE OF /G R AE V AXR T IY/ ATTRACTS THINGS TO THE EARTHS SURFACE [NOISE]
[NOISE] WITHOUT GRAVITY ON EARTH [NOISE] YOU WOULD /N/ NOT BE ABLE TO WALK [NOISE]
YOU MIGHT BOUNCE [NOISE] OR YOU WOULD FLOAT [NOISE]
[NOISE] GRAVITY CAUSES SEVERAL PROBLEMS IN SPACE [NOISE]
ASTRONAUTS DONT EAT FOOD [NOISE] THAT MAKES CRUMBS [NOISE] SINCE THEY WOULD FLOAT AROUND IN SPACE STATIONS [NOISE]
THEY USE VACUUM CLEANERS TO GET RID OF ANY CRUMBS [NOISE]
[NOISE] DROPS OF WATER IN [NOISE] A SHOWER ARE ALSO A PROBLEM [NOISE]
THEY HAVE A SHOWER /UW M/ [NOISE] WITH A DOOR THAT CLOSES AND A VACUUM CLEANER [NOISE] TO GET WATER OFF THEIR BODIES AFTER THEY ARE FINISHED [NOISE]
[NOISE] ASTRONAUTS DROP THEIR FEET [NOISE] TO THE FLOOR [NOISE] WHEN THEY USE [NOISE] THE TOILET OR THE SHOWER [NOISE]
MANY /EH N V AY ER M EH N T S/ [NOISE] MAKE LIFE EASIER /T/ FOR ASTRONAUTS IN SPACE [NOISE]
[NOISE] /AE T AXR/ THEY ARE USED IN SPACE [NOISE] PEOPLE SOMETIME [NOISE] FIND THEM USEFUL ON EARTH AS WELL
[NOISE] THE ASTRONAUTS DRINK JUICE AND MILK FROM /AH L UW N IX M AH M/ FOIL POUCHES
[NOISE] THE POUCHES COME FILLED WITH POWDER [NOISE] SO THEY CAN BE STORED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME
/S/ SOMEONE WANTS A DRINK [NOISE] THEY ADD WATER TO THE POUCHES [NOISE] OF /DH EH R/ CHOICE [NOISE]
[NOISE] THE ASTRONAUTS HAVE ALWAYS [NOISE] HAD VERY LIGHTWEIGHT AIR SUPPLIES
THESE /S/ AIR TANKS [NOISE] ARE NOW BEING USED HERE ON EARTH [NOISE]
FIREFIGHTERS [NOISE] USED TO HAVE [NOISE] VERY HEAVY AIR TANKS [NOISE] THAT WERE DIFFICULT TO CARRY AROUND [NOISE]
[NOISE] THEY WERE SO HEAVY [NOISE] THAT SOME PEOPLE /D IH IX N TD/ USE /DH AH M/ [NOISE]
THIS WAS TOO /D EY N JH R IX S/ [NOISE] SO THE ASTRONAUTS AIR SUPPLY SYSTEM [NOISE] IS NOW USED
ASTRONAUTS NEED DRILLS [NOISE] THAT ARE VERY /P AW IX F UW L/ [NOISE] FOR THEIR WORK IN SPACE
[NOISE] THEY HAVE A CORDLESS DRILL [NOISE] THAT RUNS ON BATTERIES [NOISE]
[NOISE] PEOPLE ON EARTH NOW HAVE CORDLESS VACUUM CLEANERS AND DRILLS
[NOISE] A SPACE STATION HAS MANY PARTS [NOISE]
[NOISE] A SPACE SHUTTLE CARRIES THE FIRST [NOISE] PIECE OF STATION TO ITS [NOISE] POSITION IN SPACE
HE ASTRONAUTS /W AH/ WORK FOR FIVE YEARS BUILDING THE REST OF THE STATION
WHEN THE STATION IS /F IH N IX S T/ [NOISE] SIX ASTRONAUTS WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE THERE AT ONE TIME
[NOISE] MOST PEOPLE WILL SAY [NOISE] AT THAT STATION FOR ABOUT SIX MONTHS [NOISE]
[NOISE] THE PARTS OF THE /S EY ZH IX N/ [NOISE] WHERE /DH/ THE ASTRONAUTS LIVE ARE CALLED THE /HH AE P Z/
[NOISE] WHILE AT THE STATION THEY WILL WORK ON [NOISE] SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS EVERY DAY
THERE WILL BE THREE SCIENCE LABS FOR THIS
[NOISE] OTHER EXPERIMENTS WILL BE CARRIED OUT ON OUTSIDE THE STATION [NOISE]
[NOISE] SOLAR PANELS WILL COLLECT THE ENERGY NECESSARY [NOISE] FOR THE /L EH KD T R IH S AX DX Y/ IN THE SPACE STATION
[NOISE] NOISE IS ALL AROUND /JH Y UW/ [NOISE]

[NOISE] BUT LOUD NOISES CAN BE HARMFUL [NOISE]
[NOISE] TOO MUCH LOUD NOISE CAN [NOISE] /HH/ HARM /Y ER/ EARS
[NOISE] DOCTORS SAY MORE THAN TEN MILLION PEOPLE [NOISE] IN THE /Y UW N AY IX D/ STATES HAVE HEARING PROBLEMS CAUSED BY LOUD NOISES
SOME DOCTORS SAY [NOISE] THEY ARE SEEING MORE /CH IX D R IH N/ WITH HEARING PROBLEMS OF THAT KIND [NOISE]
[NOISE] SOME KIDS IN MISSOURI LEARNED THAT EVERYDAY NOISES [NOISE] CAN HARM THEIR EARS
THERE WERE SPECIAL MACHINES THAT [NOISE] KEPT TRACK OF NOISY THEY HEARD EACH DAY
SOME NOISES WERE VERY LOUD
[NOISE] THE SOUND OF KIDS YELLING [NOISE] ON THE SCHOOL BUS CAN BE LOUD ENOUGH [NOISE] TO HARM KIDS EARS
[NOISE] NOISE MADE BY VIDEO GAMES [NOISE] CAN DO HARM ALSO [NOISE]
[NOISE] /Y ER/ EARS [NOISE] PICK UP SOUNDS MADE BY [NOISE] MANY THINGS [NOISE]
THE SOUNDS MAKE TINY HAIRS [NOISE] DEEP INSIDE YOUR EAR /S/ MOVE
[NOISE] THOSE HAIRS [NOISE] SEND MESSAGES [NOISE] TO YOUR BRAIN [NOISE]
[NOISE]/THEN YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOU [NOISE] WHAT SOUNDS /Y ER/ HEARING
LOUD NOISES CAN BE HARM [NOISE] TO TINY HAIRS INSIDE YOUR EAR
NOISE MIGHT MAKE SOME OF THOSE HAIRS /D/ [NOISE]
[NOISE] THEN YOU CAN HEAR AS WELL [NOISE] AS YOU USED TO HEAR [NOISE]
